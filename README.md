# Gas Delegate

A decentralized gas delegation and optimization framework for Stacks blockchain smart contracts, enabling efficient transaction cost management and delegation strategies.

## Overview

Gas Delegate provides a sophisticated mechanism for managing and delegating gas costs across smart contract interactions. By implementing a flexible delegation protocol, it allows developers and users to optimize transaction expenses, share gas burdens, and create more cost-effective blockchain interactions.

## Key Features

- Flexible gas delegation strategies
- Secure principal-based gas cost sharing
- Dynamic gas limit management
- Transparent gas cost tracking
- Customizable delegation permissions

## Architecture

### Gas Delegation Core Components

1. **Delegation Manager**
   - Handles gas delegation registrations
   - Manages delegation permissions
   - Tracks delegation quotas and usage

2. **Gas Cost Tracker**
   - Records transaction gas consumption
   - Provides historical gas usage insights
   - Supports analytics and optimization

3. **Delegation Authorization**
   - Implements access control for gas delegation
   - Verifies delegation permissions
   - Prevents unauthorized gas spending

## Smart Contract Examples

### Delegation Registration
```clarity
;; Register a gas delegation agreement
(define-public (register-delegation 
  (delegator principal)
  (delegate principal)
  (max-gas-limit uint)
  (expiration uint))
  ...)
```

### Gas Usage Verification
```clarity
;; Check if a delegation is valid and within limits
(define-read-only (is-delegation-valid
  (delegator principal)
  (delegate principal)
  (requested-gas uint))
  ...)
```

## Security Considerations

- Strict permission checks
- Configurable delegation limits
- Expiration-based delegation management
- Comprehensive event logging

## Usage

1. Deploy Gas Delegate contracts
2. Register delegation agreements
3. Configure gas spending permissions
4. Execute transactions through delegated principals

## Installation

Deployment order:
1. Delegation Authorization
2. Gas Cost Tracker
3. Delegation Manager

## Development

Built using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain.
